## How to contribute to barbershop

### Expectations

barbershop was developed and will be maintined in my spare time, so while I will try
and make fixes as they arise. If I take a particularly long time, you might be better served to clone the repository, branch off,
and hack up a fix yourself--- or try pinging me again to get my attention.

### Did you find a bug?

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/ojhall94/barbershop/issues). If you're unable to find an
open issue addressing the problem, [open a new
one](https://github.com/ojhall94/barbershop/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title
and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and the
simplest possible **code sample** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is
not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Ensure the PR description
clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number
if applicable.

### Do you have questions about the code?

Drop me an email, a tweet, or a message on any of the platforms below!

I hope barbershop helps enhance your science. Have fun!
